# 🧠 nanoGPT on Google Colab

A simple, readable tool to train a small “smart” text model (GPT) right in your browser—no fancy setup needed.

---

## 1. What You’ll Be Doing

* **Train a mini-language model**: Like those that guess the next word in a sentence.
* **Run everything in Colab**: No local installation—Google provides the computing power.
* **See immediate results**: Watch the model learn and then generate text.

The base project we're using, **nanoGPT**, is designed to be fast, simple, and approachable ([github.com][1]).

---

## 2. Why Use Colab?

* **Free access** to a GPU (fast processor for AI work).
* **Zero installation**—it runs fully in your browser.
* **Shareable**—just share the link, and others can use it too.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### A. Open the Colab Notebook

1. Visit this GitHub repo in Colab:

   * `https://github.com/pankajBande/nanoGPT`
2. Find a file ending with `.ipynb`—that’s the Colab notebook.
3. Click **“Open in Colab”** (blue button). This launches it in Google Colaboratory.

---

### B. Run the Notebook (All Cells)

* At the top, click **“Runtime” → “Run all”**.
* This runs sections to:

  1. Install necessary tools (like PyTorch).
  2. Download a small text sample (e.g., Shakespeare).
  3. Train a mini model (few minutes).
  4. Generate text using the trained model.

You DON'T need to understand each line—just wait and observe.

---

### C. Understand What Happens

* **Setup**: Installs needed software.
* **Download data**: Grabs example text (\~1 MB).
* **Training**: Teaches the model to predict the next letter or word.
* **Generation**: The model writes new text based on what it learned.

---

### D. No Code Needed

* You just press “Run”—the notebook is written so even non-tech people can follow along.
* Each section has simple comments like:

  > “This installs necessary tools”
  > “Training is happening here—estimated 3 minutes”

---

## 4. What to Expect

* **Time**: Training takes \~3–10 minutes (depends on GPU availability).
* **Result**: A text snippet generated by the model—sometimes fun, often quirky!
* **No expertise required**: Just point, click, and enjoy.

---

## 5. Next Steps (If You're Curious)

* Try different text data (e.g., your own writing).
* Adjust settings—like how long the model trains.
* Explore fancy features (optional).

---

## 6. Who Can Help?

* The project’s creator, Andrej Karpathy, explains things clearly in blog posts and video guides ([in.linkedin.com][2], [github.com][3]).
* The Colab file itself includes simple, human-friendly explanations.

## ✅ Final Remark

This tool lets you **train and run a small AI model in minutes**, right in your browser. No need to install anything locally—just open Colab, run the notebook, and enjoy the results!
